## Usage

The framework is designed for ease of use. Once installed, you can set up your simulation parameters in the configuration file. Here's a basic example:

```json
{
  "domain": "polygon",
  "shape": [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1]],
  "initial_conditions": "sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)",
  "time_steps": 1000,
  "output": "results.txt"
}
```

### Running the Simulation

To execute the simulation, use the following command:

```bash
python run_simulation.py --config config.json
```

### Output

The results will be saved in the specified output file. You can visualize the results using any data visualization tool of your choice.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to set up different simulations:

### Example 1: Simple Square Domain

```json
{
  "domain": "square",
  "shape": [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1]],
  "initial_conditions": "1.0",
  "time_steps": 500,
  "output": "square_results.txt"
}
```

### Example 2: Complex Polygonal Domain

```json
{
  "domain": "polygon",
  "shape": [[0,0], [2,0], [2,1], [1,2], [0,1]],
  "initial_conditions": "exp(-((x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2))",
  "time_steps": 1000,
  "output": "polygon_results.txt"
}
```
